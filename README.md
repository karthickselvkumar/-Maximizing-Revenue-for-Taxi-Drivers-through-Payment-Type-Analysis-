## 🧪 Methodology & Analysis

**A/B Testing Framework:**  
Designed and executed an independent two-sample t-test (A/B test) to statistically compare the mean fare amounts of customers paying by credit card vs. cash.

**Data Science Stack:**  
Utilized Python with **Pandas** for efficient data manipulation and **SciPy/Statsmodels** for rigorous statistical hypothesis testing.

**Statistical Rigor:**  
Clearly defined and tested **null ($H_0$)** and **alternative ($H_a$)** hypotheses to ensure a scientific and structured approach to the business question.

## 💡 Key Findings & Impact

**Significant Revenue Differential:**  
The analysis confirmed a statistically significant difference in average fares, demonstrating that **credit card payments generate higher revenue than cash payments** (p-value: `2.86 × 10⁻¹²`).

**Actionable Business Strategy:**  
Delivered clear, data-driven recommendations to stakeholders on strategically encouraging the **higher-yielding payment method** to sustainably boost driver income and operational efficiency.
