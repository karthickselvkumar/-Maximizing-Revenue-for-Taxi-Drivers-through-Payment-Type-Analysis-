Project GoalMaximize Taxi Driver Revenue: 
Conducted a data-driven investigation to optimize revenue streams for taxi drivers by analyzing the correlation between payment type and total fare amount.

🧪 Methodology & AnalysisA/B Testing Framework: 
Designed and executed an independent two-sample t-test (A/B test) to statistically compare the mean fare amounts of customers paying by credit card vs. cash.ShutterstockData Science Stack: Utilized Python with Pandas for efficient data manipulation and Scipy/Statsmodels for rigorous statistical hypothesis testing.

Statistical Rigor: 
Clearly defined and tested null ($H_0$) and alternative ($H_a$) hypotheses to ensure a scientific and structured approach to the business question.

💡 Key Findings & ImpactSignificant Revenue Differential:
The analysis confirmed a statistically significant difference in average fares, demonstrating that credit card payments generate higher revenue than cash payments (p-value: $2.86 \times 10^{-12}$).

Actionable Business Strategy: Delivered clear, data-driven recommendations to stakeholders on strategically encouraging the higher-yielding payment method to sustainably boost driver income and operational efficiency.
